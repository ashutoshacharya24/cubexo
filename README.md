 Expense Tracker

Task Description : We want to develop a simple one page expense tracker web app where users can manage their list of expenses and income and keep a track of their account balance.Application Workflow :
1. User Logs In/Registers
2. User can see his current wallet balance (Default should be zero on registration)
3. User can add a credit entry which will increment the balance
4. User can add a debit entry which will decrement the balance.
5. User should see the list of all added transactions.
6. User can delete a transaction and as per the transaction type (credit/debit) the balance should be adjusted

After Download the file you have to stay in the project directory and hit the ``python manage.py migrate`` command,
then hit ``python manage.py runserver`` to run the local server and you will get a link ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/`` click on that to get the home page.

First of all you have to signup then it will redirect to login page
